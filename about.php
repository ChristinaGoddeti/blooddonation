<h3> A PROJECT BASED BLOOD DONATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.</h3>
<p>Blood Donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save lives.<br>
There are several types of blood donation.Each type helps meet different medical needs.
Our BDMS is just a project based website but looking unto our website we feel like launching it soon in future once it gets 
a better way.<br>
The more about our website we can say is if someone is really in need of blood our website is 24 hours available by providing you
the reference link of Blood Campus,Clinic and Hospitals.<br>
For that we have provided some links</p>
